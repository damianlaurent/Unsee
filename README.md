Thank you for downloading Unsee A.K.A "Invisiline", seemingly the only mod that adds an invisible block to the game.

I do not know Java nor any other programming language and have no idea how I even made this thig, let alone made it work. 
So feel free to improve this spaghetti source code wherever you see fit. I'm sure it is pretty inefficient!

WARNING: PROCEED WITH CAUTION BEFORE OPENING .JAVA OR .JSON FILES. IF YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL, A STUDENT, OR ANYONE ELSE "IN THE KNOW",
THIS SOURCE CODE MIGHT INCREASE YOUR RISKS OF GETTING A CEREBRAL HEMORRAGE. BE READY, UNLESS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

DISCLAIMER: I'm an artist, not a programmer. But since I care about you deeply, here are some tips on how to avoid getting a stroke
I got from ChatGPT if you are to continue regardless:


ðŸ§  How to Avoid a Stroke (Apoplexy)
  1. Manage Blood Pressure
     High blood pressure is the #1 risk factor. Aim for:
     
     * Regular monitoring.
     * A target of around 120/80 mmHg.
     * Reducing salt, stress, and alcohol intake.
     * Following prescribed medication if needed.

  3. Control Cholesterol and Diabetes
     * Eat heart-healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, fish).
     * Avoid trans fats and sugar.
     * Keep blood glucose in a normal range.

3. Quit Smoking and Limit Alcohol
     Smoking damages blood vessels and increases clot risk. Alcohol in excess raises blood pressure and weakens the heart.

4. Exercise Regularly
     Aim for 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. Walking, swimming, cycling, yoga â€” all great choices.

5. Eat a Brain-Healthy Diet
     Lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains. Less red meat, processed foods. The Mediterranean diet is a good reference.

6. Maintain a Healthy Weight
     Obesity raises the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

7. Treat Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)
     AFib increases stroke risk due to potential clots. It often requires medication and monitoring.

8. Know the Warning Signs (BE FAST)
     If someone shows signs, immediate medical help is critical:

     * Balance loss.
     * Eyesight changes.
     * Face drooping.
     * Arm weakness
     * Speech difficulty.
   
   Time to call emergency services.
   
Stay safe,

Damian.
